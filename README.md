Geographic Annotation Platform


This is a "work in progress", meaning that there's some progress, but it still largely does not work. :)

You'll need to add the Zend Framework (up to version 1.9) to the "/library/" directory as such:

/library/Zend/

Go ere to get Zend:
http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest

There's lots to do with this. It mainly does OK with interacting with the Edina/Unlock Geoparser API. It can
get results from the API, parse the result XML data and load those data into a MySQL database. Some of the 
GapVis functinality sorta works.
